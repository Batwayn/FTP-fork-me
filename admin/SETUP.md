## Setup Jira

The users are added by invite: Site Administration/User Management. Use the hexaware email address, the UI already selects the hexawareid as the username.

Create a "FTP" group and add all the users from the ftp program.

Create a project, with shared configuration w/ StationMaster. Create a scrum board, fix the swimlanes and filters, and create the epics. Give developer access to FTP group.
